v0.5.0(2/28/19)
-NOTE: DO NOT DOWNLOAD>THERE IS A BUG.
-REMOVED: Quickbar Research
-This technology was originally only in the game as a way to also increase inventory size. With the new update, this now does not matter. I may add it back if the two given quickbars are not enough to comply with the additional inventory size from this mod. I will need to look at the balance further first. FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED.
-REQUIRED: 0.17 Factorio Version
-Balancing for this mod will now go out based on the new costs to make science packs. It is important to have v0.17 to comply. Also, with the current removal of the Quickbar technology, it will not be of as much help to 0.16 and previous users.
-Balance updates to come with the 0.17 update, stay tuned.
